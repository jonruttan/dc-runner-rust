# Objective Metrics Contract (v1)

Defines the objective-aligned measurement framework for this repository.

## Purpose

Metrics are enforcement tools, not vanity counters.

The project MUST evaluate quality through a single chain:

- objectives
- metrics
- tripwires
- course-correction actions

## Objective Scorecard Model

Objective scorecard data lives in:

- `specs/governance/metrics/objective_manifest.yaml`

The scorecard report MUST be generated by:

- `scripts/objective_scorecard_report.py`

Output contracts:

- objective score range is `0.0..1.0`
- objective status is one of `green|yellow|red`
- overall score is `min(objective_scores)`
- scorecard MUST emit `tripwire_hits`
- scorecard MUST emit `course_correction_recommendations`

## Required Objectives

Objective manifest MUST define all of the following IDs:

- `OBJ-DET-PORT`
- `OBJ-SPECLANG-DECISION`
- `OBJ-MINIMAL-REUSE`
- `OBJ-META-SELF`
- `OBJ-DOCS-OPERABILITY`

## Tripwire Contract

Tripwires are hard-fail policy boundaries.

- Objective-level tripwires MUST map to governance check IDs.
- Any failing tripwire MUST set objective status to `red`.
- Governance MUST provide an explicit check that verifies configured tripwires are clean.

## Course-Correction Contract

Correction trigger conditions are configuration-driven in the objective manifest.

When correction is triggered, governance MUST require:

- baseline freeze for the affected objective
- a pending-spec entry that includes:
  - cause hypothesis
  - intended correction
  - expected metric side-effects
  - rollback condition
- at least one counter-metric assertion for the objective

## Baseline Update Notes

Objective and metric baselines are PR-updated artifacts.

Baseline updates MUST include a metadata note file:

- `specs/governance/metrics/baseline_update_notes.yaml`

Each baseline note entry MUST include:

- baseline path
- current `sha256`
- rationale
- `measurement_model_change: yes|no`

Governance MUST fail if required baseline entries are missing or stale.
